## Introduction

Since our school require 5 different points category(90 points in total) in order to graduate. But we don't have any tools or APP that help us develop a convinient way to collect those points. We always have to check out the school website and download the .xlsx file to look at tons of events that provide 1 or 2 points while the file data are really messy. Therefore, We decided to make an APP that help our students to get points in more efficient way.

**Check out my other repo for scraping school website and filter out the .xlsx file using Python**

### Features
**(map screen)**

Our main feature is using ***map visualization*** to display the location of events and how many there are. The reason we develop this function is the complexity in .xlsx file. There may some events outside the campus or empty title and so on.
This way, we could view the number of events around us.

**(current points)**

Show how many points we have now. Everytime we attend an events using our APP will automatically increase the points that event provide.

**(list of events)**

(In this pic, the point category is 智(intelligence))

Display related events in that point category, and tips on top show us if the event already attended(blue) or collected(next to the blue one). If did'nt attend or collect this event, it will represent in dotted line.

**(history)**
The attended event will be here and able to upload a photo.

**(collection)**
The collected event will be here if the user haven't decide whether to attend it or not.

**(manual)**
If the user attend other event but not on our APP, they can still update the points in different point category.
